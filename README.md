# üí´ About Me:

Hello, my name is Kashif Saleem. I am a graduate of Microverse, an online school based in San Francisco that provides a simulated real-world remote software development environment. here I spent months completely immersed in remote development, building everything from landing pages to Rails APIs using JavaScript, React, Redux, Ruby, and Rails. Collaborating with developers from around the world, I learned valuable skills such as effective communication, time management, and teamwork.

Before transitioning into software development, I worked as a managing partner and lead interior designer at KSA Design Studio. I acquired several transferable skills that are now integral to my work as a developer, including providing effective solutions to clients' problems, effective communication, and multitasking. The company's focus on prioritizing customer needs taught me the importance of a client/user-centric approach, a mindset I bring to software engineering.

üöÄ Currently, I am fully immersed in my role as a Front-end developer at Programmers Force Pvt Ltd, a prominent tech powerhouse in Pakistan. My primary focus revolves around harnessing the capabilities of Vue.js, Vuetify, and Bootstrap to drive innovation and excellence in web development. At Programmers Force, I am passionately committed to pushing the boundaries of what is achievable in the world of web technology.

üì¶ In the past, I was deeply involved in the creation of two exciting projects ‚Äì Uamuzi and Fleet Delivery Service. Uamuzi was a captivating venture into the realm of social networking, while Fleet Delivery Service aimed to revolutionize the food delivery experience. Both projects provided me with invaluable experience in React Native, significantly enhancing my expertise in mobile app development during that period.

üõ†Ô∏è In my spare time, I enthusiastically engage in open-source contributions, honing my skills in React, Next.js, and the artistry of Tailwind CSS. These endeavours not only attest to my dedication but also provide an opportunity to contribute to the developer community.

üå± üå± In my pursuit of continuous growth, I am dedicated to learning and mastering Docker, Kubernetes, and service meshes. These technologies play a pivotal role in shaping the future of modern web development, and I am excited to be part of this transformative journey.

‚ö° Fun fact: I am also an interior designer.
